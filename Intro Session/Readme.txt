B1 - Aerofoil Week 5 practical

This folder contains matlab scripts to perform the computations of the lumped vortex model for a thin aerofoil,
see notes at section 3.2.1.
The folder contains the following matlab scripts:

foil.m:                  function to compute the positions of panel vertices along a camber line.
run.m:                   driver function.


vortex.m:                velocity vector generated by a potential vortex of unit strength at given position (see Eq. 3.1)
residual.m:              residual for the panel method equations (see Eq. 3.2)
influence.m:             aerodynamic influence matrix (see Eq. 3.4)


plot1.m:                 function to plot quantities of interest
forces.m:                function to determine forces based on the estimate of pressure from Bernoulli's equation (see Eq.3.9)

The functions foil.m, run.m, plot1.m are complete. The functions vortex.m, residual.m, influence.m and forces.m have been emptied 
and only contain headers with documentation explaining how each argument should be used.
Complete the implementation of the functions based on the equations in the notes as referred above and produce graphs documenting the validity of your implementation.
